            <h2>Course Objective</h2>
            <p>The overarching goal of this course is to foster a comprehensive understanding and application of
                fundamental programming concepts through the creation of web-based programs. The course is designed to
                instill proficiency in both core programming language concepts and essential web development principles.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Programming Language Concepts</h2>
            <p>In pursuit of our objective, we will delve into the following critical programming language concepts:
                <br>
                Statements: Learning how to construct clear and concise code instructions.<br><br>
                Variables: Grasping the concept of variables and their pivotal role in programming.<br><br>
                Conditionals (If statements): Understanding conditional statements for decision-making within
                programs.<br><br>
                Loops: Mastery of loop structures to facilitate repetitive tasks.<br><br>
                Methods / Functions: Proficiency in creating and implementing functions for modular code design.<br><br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Web Programming Concepts</h2>
            <p>In parallel with programming language fundamentals, we will also explore the essential concepts of web
                development:<br>

                HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): In-depth comprehension of HTML for structuring web content.<br><br>
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): A comprehensive exploration of CSS for precise web layout and stylistic
                elements.<br><br>
                JavaScript: Proficiency in JavaScript programming, enabling dynamic web functionality.<br><br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 id="next scroll">Tools</h2>
            <p>To facilitate our learning journey, we will be utilizing the following tool:<br><br>
                Repl.it: A versatile platform for coding and project development.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Grading</h2>
            <p>There will be no conventional homework assignments or tests in this course. Instead, your performance
                will be evaluated as follows:<br>
                <br>
                50% Participation: Active engagement in in-class discussions, including both asking and answering
                questions. This encompasses individual and group participation.<br>
                <br>
                50% Projects: Your assessment will largely be based on the successful completion of in-class projects,
                culminating in the development of a comprehensive web application project.<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Expectations</h2>
            <p>To ensure your success in this course, we have outlined the following expectations:<br><br>

                Engagement with Lectures: Actively participate by following along with the lectures and experimenting with the techniques elucidated.<br><br>
                
                Weekly Submissions: Stay on track by submitting weekly assignments promptly.<br><br>
                
                Seek Clarification: Do not hesitate to seek clarification when any concept remains unclear. Effective communication is integral to your learning experience.<br><br>
                
                Creativity and Initiative: Embrace your creative spirit and challenge yourself to push boundaries when working on your projects. Innovation is encouraged and appreciated.<br><br>
                
            </p>
            <h3 id="end">By adhering to these guidelines and embracing the course materials, you will not only gain a profound understanding of programming and web development but also equip yourself with valuable skills for the future.</h3>
